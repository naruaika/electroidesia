    "Electroidesia" : "Deciduous round Asiatic trees are widely grown in mild climates as ornamental for heart-shaped leaves and fragrant yellow-green flowers followed by hanging groups of fleshy red orange fruit.",
    "Latite" : "Latite is an igneous, volcanic rock, with aphanitic-aphyric to aphyric-porphyritic texture. Its mineral assemblage is usually alkali feldspar and plagioclase in approximately equal amounts. Quartz is less than five percent and is absent in a feldspathoid-bearing latite, and olivine is absent in a quartz-bearing latite. When quartz content is greater than five percent the rock is classified as quartz latite.",
    "Manchineel" : "The name 'manchineel' (sometimes written 'manchioneel') as well as the specific epithet mancinella is from Spanish manzanilla ('little apple'), from the superficial resemblance of its fruit and leaves to those of an apple tree. A present-day Spanish name is manzanilla de la muerte, 'little apple of death'. This refers to the fact that manchineel is one of the most dangerous trees in the world. Manchineel is also known as the beach apple.",
    "Manchineel Toxicity" : "Do not eat, touch, or even inhale the air around the manchineel tree. All parts of the manchineel tree contain strong toxins, some unidentified. Standing beneath the tree during rain will cause blistering of the skin from mere contact with this liquid (even a small drop of rain with the milky substance in it will cause the skin to blister)."
