        "Latite", "Latite is an igneous, volcanic rock, with aphanitic-aphyric to aphyric-porphyritic texture. Its mineral assemblage is usually alkali feldspar and plagioclase in approximately equal amounts. Quartz is less than five percent and is absent in a feldspathoid-bearing latite, and olivine is absent in a quartz-bearing latite. When quartz content is greater than five percent the rock is classified as quartz latite."

        "Manchineel", "The manchineel tree (Hippomane mancinella) is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae). The name 'manchineel' (sometimes written 'manchioneel') as well as the specific epithet mancinella is from Spanish manzanilla ('little apple'), from the superficial resemblance of its fruit and leaves to those of an apple tree. A present-day Spanish name is manzanilla de la muerte, 'little apple of death'. This refers to the fact that manchineel is one of the most dangerous trees in the world. Manchineel is also known as the beach apple."
